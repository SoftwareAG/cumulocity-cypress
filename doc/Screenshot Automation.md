# Screenshot Automation 

With the `c8yscrn` command, `cumulocity-cypress` provides a tool to automate taking screenshots of your Cumulocity IoT applications as part of your test suite or CI/CD workflows. This document explains how to install and use the tool, its command-line options, configuration file structure, and integration with existing Cypress projects.

Built on top of [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), `c8yscrn` comes with all [screenshot capabilities](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) provided by Cypress wrapped into a yaml workflow definition, without writing Cypress tests or Cypress know-how.

Summary of capabilities:
* Configuration of screenshot workflows in yaml format
* Actions to apply before taking screenshots (click, type, highlight, wait, etc.)
* Screenshots of the entire viewport, specific DOM elements, or custom-defined areas
* Login, language and date/time settings per screenshot
* Configuration of viewport size, image padding and scaling, timeouts, and more
* Tagging of screenshots and version requirements for filtering and grouping
* Standalone and integrated modes to run without or within existing Cypress projects
* Supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Electron)
* YAML validation and auto-completion for IDEs, e.g., Visual Studio Code
* Init command to create a default configuration file
* Environment variables for configuration settings via `.env` files

The yaml based screenshot workflows typically begin with a visit of a specific URL in the Cumulocity application, followed by a series of actions such as clicking buttons, typing text, or highlighting elements. After these interactions, the tool captures screenshots, which can be of the entire viewport, specific DOM elements, or custom-defined areas of the page.

Example of a screenshot workflow:
```yaml
global:
  viewportWidth: 1920
  viewportHeight: 1080
  language: en
  user: admin

screenshots:
  - image: /images/example
    visit: "/apps/example/index.html#/"
    actions:
      - type: 
        selector: "#search"
        value: "Test Input"
      - highlight:
        - selector: .c8y-right-drawer__header > .d-flex
          styles:
            outline: dashed
            "outline-offset": "+3px"
            "outline-color": "red"
        - selector: "#main-content"
          border: 2px solid green
      - click:
          selector: 
            data-cy: right-drawer-toggle-button
```

The example workflow creates a single screenshot. For the screenshot it first visits a specific URL in the Cumulocity application, types text into a search field, highlights two elements on the page, and clicks a button. At the end of the workflow, `c8yscrn` automatically captures a screenshot of the page and stores it in the location defined by the root image property.

## Installation and Usage

The screenshot automation provided by `cumulocity-cypress` can be used standalone or within an existing Cypress project. The installation and usage differs slightly between these two usage scenarios.

### For Standalone Users

#### Installation
Install `cumulocity-cypress` globally and run the `c8yscrn` command from the command line:

```bash
npm install -g cumulocity-cypress

c8yscrn --help
```

By default, it will look for a configuration file named `c8yscrn.config.yaml` in the current directory.

#### Command Line Options

`c8yscrn` supports the following command-line options:

```
Usage: c8yscrn [options]

Options:
      --version  Show version number                                                       [boolean]
  -c, --config   The yaml config file           [string] [required] [default: "c8yscrn.config.yaml"]
  -f, --folder   The target folder for the screenshots                                      [string]
  -u, --baseUrl  The Cumulocity base url                                                    [string]
  -b, --browser  Browser to use                                         [string] [default: "chrome"]
  -i, --init     Initialize the config file                               [boolean] [default: false]
  -t, --tags     Run only screenshot workflows with the given tags                           [array]
      --help     Show help                                                                 [boolean]
```

To get started, run the `init` command to create a new configuration file:

```bash
# Use the default configuration file name
c8yscrn --init
# Specify a custom configuration file name
c8yscrn --init --config my-screenshot-config.yaml
# Specify the base URL of your Cumulocity instance and write it to the configuration file
c8yscrn --init --config my-screenshot-config.yaml --baseUrl https://my-cumulocity-instance.com
```

### Integrate in to existing Cypress Projects

#### Installation

Install `cumulocity-cypress` in your Cypress project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev cumulocity-cypress
```

#### Configuration

Update your `cypress.config.ts` file to load the plugin required to configure the screenshot automation:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
import { configureC8yScreenshotPlugin } from "cumulocity-cypress/plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:4200",
    supportFile: false,
    video: false,
    videosFolder: "videos",
    screenshotsFolder: "screenshots",
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      configureC8yScreenshotPlugin(on, config);
      return config;
    },
  },
});
```

The `configureC8yScreenshotPlugin` function sets up the necessary event handlers and configurations for the `C8yScreenshotRunner` to work within your Cypress project. It enables features like:

- Loading and parsing the YAML configuration file
- Setting up custom commands for screenshot actions
- Configuring Cypress to handle the custom screenshot workflows

By default, the plugin looks for a configuration file named `c8yscrn.config.yaml` in the root of your project. You can customize the configuration file path by passing the name of the config file as an argument to the `configureC8yScreenshotPlugin` function:

```typescript
configureC8yScreenshotPlugin(on, config, "my-screenshot-config.yaml");
```

As an alternative you can also read the yaml configuration in `cypress.config.ts` and pass it to the plugin:

```typescript
let myYamlConfig: ScreenshotSetup;
try {
  configureC8yScreenshotPlugin(on, config, "my-screenshot-config.yaml");
} catch (error: any) {
  throw new Error(`Error reading config file. ${error.message}`);
}

configureC8yScreenshotPlugin(on, config, myYamlConfig);
```

#### Add a Test File for Screenshot workflow

Create a new file, e.g. `screenshot.cy.ts`, in your Cypress project folder to host `C8yScreenshotRunner`:

```typescript
import { C8yScreenshotRunner } from 'cumulocity-cypress';

describe('My Custom Screenshot Automation', () => {
  const runner = new C8yScreenshotRunner();
  runner.run();
});
```

When integrating into an existing Cypress project, you'll use the `C8yScreenshotRunner` in your test files. See the "Using C8yScreenshotRunner in Your Project" section for details.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used to overwrite configuration settings in the `c8yscrn.config.yaml` file. This can be useful for setting sensitive information like usernames and passwords, or for providing values for CI/CD environments.

The following environment variables are supported:
- `C8Y_BASEURL`: The base URL of the Cumulocity instance.
- `C8Y_TENANT`: The tenant id used for authentication. Will be determined from the base URL if not provided.
- `C8Y_USERNAME`: The username to use for authentication.
- `C8Y_PASSWORD`: The password to use for authentication.
- `C8Y_SHELL_VERSION`: The version of the shell application to validate `requires` version dependencies.
- `C8Y_SHELL_NAME`: The name of the shell application to use for determining the shell version (default is "cockpit").
- `C8Y_BROWSER_LAUNCH_ARGS`: Additional arguments to pass to the browser when launching.
- `C8Y_CHROME_LAUNCH_ARGS`: Additional arguments to pass to the Chrome browser when launching.
- `C8Y_FIREFOX_LAUNCH_ARGS`: Additional arguments to pass to the Firefox browser when launching.
- `C8Y_ELECTRON_LAUNCH_ARGS`: Additional arguments to pass to the Electron browser when launching.

To use different credentials in your workflows, see the [Authentication](#authentication) section for more details.

When using `c8yscrn` standalone, you can configure environment variables in a `.env` file or `.c8yscrn` file in the current working directory. This files should contain key-value pairs in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

When using the screenshot automation in an existing Cypress project, you can set environment variables in your `cypress.env.json` file or via the command line using the `--env` option. For more details see the [Cypress environment variables documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables).

## Authentication

To authenticate with Cumulocity, you can 
- use `C8Y_USERNAME` and `C8Y_PASSWORD` environment variables
- set the `user` property in the global settings of your configuration file
- set the `user` property of the `visit` object (overrides global setting)

The `user` property refers to an alias that is used to look up the actual user ID and password from the `*user*_username` and `*user*_password` environment variables. 

The following example defines and uses the user `admin` for authentication:

```yaml
global:
  user: admin
```

Corresponding .c8yscrn file:
```properties
admin_username: myusername
admin_password: mypassword
```

Corresponding cypress.env.json file:
```json
{
  "admin_username": "myusername",
  "admin_password": "mypassword"
}
```

If all screenshot workflows use the same user, you can also use `C8Y_USERNAME` and `C8Y_PASSWORD` environment variables instead of defining a user alias.

## Selectors

A (CSS) selector is used to identify one or multiple DOM elements and is specified in the yaml configuration as string or object. While the string represents a CSS selector, the selector object currently only provides a convenience wrapper for Cypress's `data-cy` selectors. Selectors are required for actions like clicking, typing, highlighting, and waiting.

See [Understanding Selectors in Frontend Development and Cypress Testing](https://www.cypress.io/blog/understanding-selectors-in-testing) for more information on selectors and how they are used in Cypress.

Examples of selectors:
```yaml
- click:
  selector: .c8y-right-drawer__header > .d-flex
- wait:
  selector: "#main-content"
- click:
  selector:
    data-cy: right-drawer-toggle-button
```

Please note, a selector can match multiple elements. In this case, all elements will be affected by the action. If you want to target a specific element, make sure the selector is unique.

## Tags

Tags are used to group and filter screenshot workflows. They can be defined globally or per screenshot. 

Tags are useful for organizing and categorizing screenshots, e.g., by functionality, feature, or test type. When running the `c8yscrn` command, you can specify tags to filter which screenshots to run.

```bash
c8yscrn --tags "dashboard, regression"
```

## Version Requirements

Version requirements allow you to specify the minimum version of the (shell) application required to run a screenshot workflow. This is required if a screenshot workflow needs to run against different versions of an application. If the (shell) application doesn't fulfill this requirement, the screenshot workflow will be skipped. 

To configure the application or plugin, use the `shell` property in the global settings or the specific screenshot configuration. The default shell application is `cockpit`. 

The `requires` property should be a [semver range](https://devhints.io/semver) that the application version must satisfy.

```yaml
global:
  shell: "myexampleapp"
  requires: ">=1019.0.0"

screenshots:
- image: /images/example
  requires: ">=1020.0.0"
```

## Worlflow File

The configuration file (`c8yscrn.config.yaml`) is the heart of your screenshot automation. It defines global settings and individual screenshot workflows. Here's a detailed explanation of its structure and properties:

```yaml
global:
  viewportWidth: 1920
  viewportHeight: 1080
  language: en
  user: admin
  shell: "example"
  requires: "1017"
  tags: 
    - screenshot

screenshots:
  - image: /images/example1
    visit: "/apps/example/index.html#/"
    tags: 
      - "example"

  - image: /images/example2
    requires: ">=1019.0.0"
    visit:
      url: "/apps/example/index.html#/"
    actions:
      - screenshot:          
          clip:
            x: 100
            y: 100
            width: -100
            height: -250
